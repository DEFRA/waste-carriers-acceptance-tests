# This is completly bogus data. However because of the way Cucumber works
# all features and steps get initialised when we run Quke, its just that during
# CI we then choose to only run those tagged @ci.
# As some of the page objects expect there to be data read in from a .config.yml
# the build will fail if there isn't one.
# Hence this is here just to cater for just for this specific scenario
