# With Cucumber everything gets loaded into the 'world' from the start so there
# is no single point of entry where we can instantiate and control state that
# that needs to be shared. One of the ways this manifests is with helper
# methods. Typically if you have one you place it in
# `features/support/helpers.rb` and it is then available globally in your
# steps. However on larger projects like this where you want to to give some
# clarity as to where a method is defined, and ensure there are no collisions
# it is preferable to namespace them.
#
# This blocks it from being included out of the box and the fix is simply to
# add `include MyHelpersNamespace` either in the file where its used, or with
# the pattern we've adopted which is after the module has been defined.
#
# As we are not including it from within another module or class instance
# Rubocop quite rightly throughs this error, but as this is how Cucumber behaves
# we have to disable this cop.
Style/MixinUsage:

# When using Ruby >= 2.3, Rubocop wants to add a comment to the top of *.rb
# to aid migration to frozen literals in Ruby 3.0. We are not interested in
# modifying every file at this point, so this cop is disabled for now.
