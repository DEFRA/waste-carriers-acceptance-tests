Feature: Assisted digital registration of an upper tier partnership
  As a carrier of commerical waste
  I want assistance with my waste carrier registration from the Environment Agency
  So I can complete my regisration and I am compliant with the law

  # Background:
  #   Given I sign into the back office as "agency-user"
  #   When I register an upper tier "partnership" from the back office
  #
  # # TODO: convert these to new app and bring in others from recycle bin:
  #   Given an Environment Agency user has signed in to the backend
  #   And I request assistance with a new registration
  #   When I have my partnership upper tier regstration completed for me on backend
  #
  # Scenario: NCCC successfully registers a partnership for a upper tier waste carriers licence paying by credit card
  #   When I pay for my application over the phone by maestro ordering 2 copy cards
  #   Then I will have an upper tier registration
  #   And the registration status will be "Registered"
